```rust
      fn hash_to_F(dst: &[u8], data: &[u8]) -> Self::F {
        Scalar::from_hash(Sha512::new_with_prefix(&[dst, data].concat()))
      }
```

```rust
/// hash_to_F is implemented with a naive concatenation of the dst and data, allowing transposition
/// between the two. This means `dst: b"abc", data: b"def"`, will produce the same scalar as
/// `dst: "abcdef", data: b""`. Please use carefully, not letting dsts be substrings of each other.
```

**File:** crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs (L49-56)
```rust
  /// Hash the provided domain-separation tag and message to a scalar. Ciphersuites MAY naively
  /// prefix the tag to the message, enabling transpotion between the two. Accordingly, this
  /// function should NOT be used in any scheme where one tag is a valid substring of another
  /// UNLESS the specific Ciphersuite is verified to handle the DST securely.
  ///
  /// Verifying specific ciphersuites have secure tag handling is not recommended, due to it
  /// breaking the intended modularity of ciphersuites. Instead, component-specific tags with
  /// further purpose tags are recommended ("Schnorr-nonce", "Schnorr-chal").
