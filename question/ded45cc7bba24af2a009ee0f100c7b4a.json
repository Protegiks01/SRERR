  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::transcript()] [Generator Index - High] Does the transcript include which generator each commitment corresponds to, or could generator confusion lead to incorrect binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::new()] [Nonce Independence - Critical] Are all generated nonces independent, or could correlation between nonces lead to signature forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::new()] [Empty Input - Medium] What happens if planned_nonces is empty - does this create a valid but useless Commitments struct?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::new()] [Generator List Validation - High] Could different nonces using different generator lists cause confusion in later binding factor calculations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::new()] [RNG State - High] Is the RNG state properly updated between nonce generations, or could poor RNG state management lead to related nonces?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::new()] [Vector Capacity - Low] Does pre-allocating vectors with vec![] without capacity lead to multiple reallocations and potential side-channel timing leaks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::transcript()] [Domain Separation - Critical] Does domain_separate(b'commitments') before iterating nonces prevent confusion between single-nonce and multi-nonce contexts?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::transcript()] [Nonce Ordering - High] Is the order of nonces in the transcript deterministic and consistent with how they're used in signing?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::transcript()] [Participant Binding - High] Does the transcript include participant identifiers, or could commitments from different participants be confused?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::read()] [Length Consistency - High] Does read() verify that the number of commitment sets matches generators.len(), or could mismatches cause index out-of-bounds?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::read()] [Generator Reference - Medium] Could the generators slice reference be invalid or change during the read operation, causing inconsistent results?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::read()] [Error Propagation - Medium] If NonceCommitments::read fails partway through, is the partially constructed Commitments properly cleaned up?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::write()] [Write Ordering - Medium] Is the write order consistent with read order to ensure proper deserialization?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: Commitments::write()] [Partial Writes - Medium] Could a partial write failure leave the stream in an inconsistent state for subsequent operations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::insert()] [Duplicate Participants - High] Does insert() check for duplicate participant IDs, or could inserting the same participant twice overwrite their commitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::insert()] [Binding Factor State - High] Is binding_factors intentionally set to None on insert, and could this be exploited to reset a participant's binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::insert()] [Participant Validation - Medium] Is the Participant ID validated to be within the expected range, or could invalid IDs cause issues?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Transcript Cloning - High] Does cloning the transcript preserve all prior state, or could incomplete clones lead to different binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Participant Ordering - Critical] Are participants processed in a deterministic order from the HashMap, or could non-deterministic iteration lead to consensus divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Participant ID Encoding - High] Is C::F::from(u64::from(u16::from(*l))) the correct way to encode participant IDs in the transcript, and could overflow occur?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Binding Factor Uniqueness - Critical] Does generating one binding factor per nonce prevent cross-nonce binding factor reuse, or is this overly cautious?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Hash Function - High] Does C::hash_binding_factor provide adequate domain separation and collision resistance for binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Challenge Label - Medium] Is the label b'rho' consistent across all FROST implementations, or could label mismatch cause interoperability issues?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Overwrite Protection - High] Could calculate_binding_factors be called multiple times, and would this overwrite existing binding factors creating confusion?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::calculate_binding_factors()] [Empty Commitments - Medium] What happens if a participant has zero nonces - does this create an empty binding_factors vector?"
