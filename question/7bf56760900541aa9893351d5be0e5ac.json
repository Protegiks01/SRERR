  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Overall: Message handling] [Message Binding - CRITICAL] In Serai's processor, messages are transaction plans. If the message m passed to hram is not cryptographically bound to the blockchain state (block hash, nonce), can a coordinator replay old signing requests, causing validators to sign duplicate transactions and enabling double-spend attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Function: IetfEd448Hram::hram()] [Nonce Generation - CRITICAL] The R parameter should be derived from per-participant random nonces. If nonce generation uses insufficient randomness or reuses nonces, can an attacker recover secret keys from two signatures with the same R but different messages?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Overall: Public key handling] [Group Key Verification - HIGH] The A parameter is the aggregate group public key. Is A verified to be correctly derived from participant public keys before use in hram? Can a malicious participant substitute a rogue key, causing signatures to validate under an attacker-controlled key?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Overall: Challenge use] [Lambda Coefficient Binding - HIGH] FROST signature shares use Lagrange coefficients. If the challenge from hram is not properly bound to the set of signing participants, can an attacker reuse shares from one participant set in another, breaking the threshold property?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Function: IetfEd448Hram::hram()] [Coordinator Equivocation - HIGH] If a malicious coordinator sends different (R, A, m) values to different processors, causing them to compute different challenges, will the signing protocol detect this, or will it silently fail with inconsistent shares?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Overall: Test vectors] [Vector Validation - MEDIUM] Are there test vectors validating that Ietf8032Ed448Hram and IetfEd448Hram produce correct challenges matching RFC-8032 and IETF FROST specifications? Missing tests could leave vulnerabilities undetected until production use.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Function: Ietf8032Ed448Hram::hram()] [Context Edge Cases - LOW] Are edge cases tested: empty context, max length context (255 bytes), context with special characters, or binary data? Untested edge cases could cause unexpected behavior in production.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Function: IetfEd448Hram::hram()] [Cross-Implementation Testing - MEDIUM] Are the challenge values produced by IetfEd448Hram validated against other FROST Ed448 implementations? Incompatibility could prevent Serai from interoperating with other threshold signature systems.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Overall: Invalid input handling] [Fuzzing Coverage - MEDIUM] Has the hram implementation been fuzzed with malformed points, invalid scalars, or extreme input lengths? Unfuzzed code could have crash or correctness bugs triggerable by malicious inputs.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 9: CONTEXT constant] [Immutability - LOW] The CONTEXT is a const, ensuring it cannot be modified. However, if upstream code attempts to modify it via unsafe code, could this compromise domain separation across the entire system?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Lines 11-13: Curve impl] [Trait Method Override - LOW] The Curve trait implementation only provides CONTEXT. Are all other Curve trait methods (hash_to_F, hash_binding_factor, etc.) correctly using this CONTEXT value? If any method bypasses the CONTEXT, domain separation is broken.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 17: Ietf8032Ed448Hram struct] [Visibility - LOW] Ietf8032Ed448Hram is pub(crate), limiting its exposure. If external code needs RFC-8032 compatible signing (not just FROST), does restricting this type prevent legitimate use cases or force unsafe workarounds?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 20: hram signature] [Parameter Types - MEDIUM] The hram method takes &Point and &[u8]. Does the Point type ensure it represents a valid curve point, or can invalid/identity points be passed? Invalid points in R or A would corrupt challenge computation.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 21: Scalar::wide_reduce call] [Function Correctness - CRITICAL] The wide_reduce function is in crypto/ed448/src/scalar.rs. If wide_reduce has bugs (incorrect modulus, wrong byte order, bias), all Ed448 signatures in Serai would be invalid or forgeable, risking total loss of funds.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 22: Ed448::H::digest] [Hash Instantiation - MEDIUM] Ed448::H is Shake256_114. If this type is incorrectly configured (wrong output size, wrong algorithm), digest() will return wrong-sized output, causing try_into().unwrap() to panic on every signing attempt.",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Lines 23-28: Concatenation chain] [Order Sensitivity - HIGH] The order is [prefix || context || R || A || m]. If any component is omitted or reordered, challenge computation changes. Are all calling sites guaranteed to maintain this exact order, or could refactoring introduce bugs?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 24: Context length byte] [Length Encoding - MEDIUM] The context length is encoded as a single u8. This limits context to 255 bytes. Is this limit documented and enforced at all context creation sites? Can user-supplied context exceed this, causing unwrap panic?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 26: to_bytes() calls] [Serialization Consistency - HIGH] R.to_bytes() and A.to_bytes() must produce deterministic, canonical encodings. If different Ed448 implementations produce different encodings, will signature verification fail across implementations, breaking interoperability?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 30: as_ref()] [Slice Conversion - LOW] The digest is converted to a slice with as_ref(). If as_ref() doesn't return the full digest, or returns wrong portion, try_into() will fail. Is Output<Ed448::H> guaranteed to be convertible to [u8; 114]?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 31: try_into()] [Array Conversion - MEDIUM] Converting Vec to fixed-size array [u8; 114] via try_into(). If Shake256_114 ever returns a different size, this will panic. Are there compile-time guarantees the size is exactly 114?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 39: IetfEd448Hram struct] [Public Visibility - LOW] IetfEd448Hram is pub, exposing it to external crates.

  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 42: hram signature] [API Surface - MEDIUM] The Hram trait's hram method doesn't take a context parameter (unlike Ietf8032Ed448Hram). This matches FROST spec where context is empty. But if code incorrectly uses Ietf8032Ed448Hram directly instead of IetfEd448Hram, will type checking catch this?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Line 43: Empty context call] [Hard-coded Empty Context - MEDIUM] Passing &[] as context is hard-coded. If FROST specification changes to require a non-empty context for domain separation, this would need updating. Is this assumption documented and validated?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/ed448.rs] [Overall: Multi-curve support] [Curve Confusion - HIGH] Serai supports multiple curves (Ed25519, Ed448, Secp256k1, P256, Ristretto). If a signature generated with Ed448 can be reinterpreted as valid under a different curve, can an attacker replay signatures across curves, spending funds from multiple addresses with a single signature?"
