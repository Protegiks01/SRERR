  "[File: serai/crypto/multiexp/src/batch.rs] [Function: flat()] [Medium - Signature Forgery] What happens if flat() receives a slice with empty inner Vecs? Does the flat_map handle this correctly?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/multiexp/src/batch.rs] [Function: queue()] [High - Signature Forgery] Can statements be queued with duplicate points but different scalars, and could this enable cancellation attacks?",

  "[File: serai/crypto/multiexp/src/batch.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Medium - DoS] Can methods be called in an unexpected order (e.g., verify() before queue()) that causes panics or undefined behavior?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/multiexp/src/batch.rs] [Function: queue()] [Critical - Signature Forgery] Can an attacker submit statements where G points are the identity element, making any scalar value trivially verify, and exploit random weighting to hide this?",

  "[File: serai/crypto/multiexp/src/batch.rs] [Function: verify()] [Critical - Signature Forgery] Does the multiexp at line 94 validate that all input points are on the curve, or could invalid curve points bypass verification?",
