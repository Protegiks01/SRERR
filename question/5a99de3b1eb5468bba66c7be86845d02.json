  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Birthday Bound - MEDIUM] With naive concatenation, does the birthday bound for collisions differ from properly domain-separated hash_to_F? Can this reduce security margins? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Type: Scalar] [Small Subgroup Injection - MEDIUM] Can an attacker inject small-subgroup elements during scalar-to-point operations derived from hash_to_F, enabling attacks on discrete log security? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Aggregation Malleability - HIGH] In MuSig-style key aggregation, can the dst/data transposition vulnerability allow an attacker to create malleable aggregated keys that appear different but produce equivalent signatures? [Severity: HIGH]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Participant Commitment Collision - HIGH] Can hash_to_F collisions cause two different sets of participants to produce the same aggregated commitment, enabling participant substitution attacks in threshold signing? [Severity: HIGH]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Delinearization Bypass - MEDIUM] MuSig requires delinearization to prevent rogue key attacks. If delinearization coefficients are derived via hash_to_F, can dst/data manipulation weaken this protection? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Protocol Upgrade Incompatibility - HIGH] If a future version of Serai fixes the dst/data concatenation issue, will old signatures become invalid, and could this be exploited during migration to fork the network? [Severity: HIGH]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Constant: ID] [ID Migration Risk - MEDIUM] If ciphersuite IDs change in a protocol upgrade, can validators with mixed versions derive incompatible keys, splitting the validator set? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: generator()] [Generator Update Attack - LOW] If the underlying curve library updates its canonical generator, can this cause incompatibility between old and new validator instances? [Severity: LOW]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Test: test_ristretto()] [Negative Test Missing - MEDIUM] The tests verify correct outputs, but are there tests that verify incorrect outputs are rejected? Can a subtle bug allow invalid scalars to be accepted? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Test: test_ed25519()] [Cross-Implementation Testing - MEDIUM] Are the test vectors validated against independent Ed25519 and Ristretto implementations, or only against the dalek-ff-group library itself? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Fuzzing Coverage - MEDIUM] Has hash_to_F been fuzzed with random dst/data inputs to detect panics, overflows, or unexpected behaviors? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Property Testing - LOW] Are there property-based tests that verify hash_to_F produces scalars in the correct range, with proper distribution, and without bias? [Severity: LOW]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Transaction ID Collision - HIGH] If transaction IDs are hashed into signatures via hash_to_F, can the dst/data boundary manipulation cause two different transactions to produce the same signature challenge, enabling transaction substitution? [Severity: HIGH]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Address Derivation Collision - HIGH] If addresses or account identifiers are derived using hash_to_F, can dst/data transposition cause two different users to derive the same address, enabling fund theft? [Severity: HIGH]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-f-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Timestamp Binding Bypass - MEDIUM] If timestamps are incorporated into signatures via hash_to_F, can an attacker manipulate the dst/data boundary to make an old signature appear valid for a new timestamp, enabling replay attacks? [Severity: MEDIUM]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Nonce Commitment Forgery - CRITICAL] FROST requires nonce commitments to be binding. Can the dst/data transposition vulnerability allow an attacker to open a single commitment to multiple nonces, breaking the binding property and enabling signature forgery? [Severity: CRITICAL]",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dalek-ff-group/src/ciphersuite.rs] [Function: hash_to_F()] [Key Derivation Collision - CRITICAL] If HD-wallet-style key derivation uses hash_to_F with a master key and derivation path, can dst/data manipulation cause two different derivation paths to produce the same child key, breaking key hierarchy security? [Severity: CRITICAL]"
