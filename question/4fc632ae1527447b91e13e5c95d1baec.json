  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Crypto: Group order, Line 37] **HIGH**: Does PrimeGroup guarantee that the group order matches the field order? Could order mismatches break signature verification?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Crypto: Hash collision resistance, Line 40] **MEDIUM**: Does SecureDigest guarantee collision resistance, or only preimage resistance? Could hash collisions break binding commitments?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Crypto: Scalar inversion, Line 35] **MEDIUM**: Does PrimeField provide constant-time inversion? Could timing leaks during signature verification reveal private keys?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Crypto: Point addition, Line 37] **MEDIUM**: Does Group provide constant-time addition? Could timing during multisig key aggregation leak individual key shares?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Feature: std vs no_std, Lines 3-10] **MEDIUM**: Could behavior differences between std and no_std builds cause validators running different configurations to diverge?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Feature: alloc dependency, Lines 6-27] **LOW**: If alloc feature is disabled, do read_F() and read_G() become unavailable, breaking validator deserialization?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Feature: cfg gating, Lines 72-101] **MEDIUM**: The read functions are gated on 'alloc' or 'std' - could validators without these features accept signatures they can't verify?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic: Scalar operations, Line 35] **MEDIUM**: Does PrimeField wrap or panic on overflow? Could overflow during signature aggregation create invalid signatures that pass verification?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Arithmetic: Point operations, Line 37] **LOW**: Could point addition overflow intermediate coordinates before reduction, leaking information via timing?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Platform: Endianness, Lines 75-93] **HIGH**: Are encoding/decoding operations endian-independent? Could ARM validators disagree with x86 validators on key values?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Platform: Word size, Lines 35-37] **LOW**: On 32-bit vs 64-bit platforms, could field/group operations produce different results due to different intermediate precision?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Platform: SIMD, Line 37] **LOW**: If Group uses SIMD optimizations, could different CPU features (AVX2 vs NEON) cause non-deterministic results?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Optimization level, Line 81] **MEDIUM**: At higher optimization levels, could the compiler remove the zeroize() call as a 'dead store'?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Inlining, Lines 62-69] **LOW**: Could aggressive inlining of random_nonzero_F() cause the loop to be unrolled in unexpected ways?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Compiler: Link-time optimization, Lines 30-102] **LOW**: Could LTO merge identical hash_to_F() implementations from different ciphersuites, breaking domain separation?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Doc: hash_to_F() warning, Lines 49-56] **MEDIUM**: The documentation warns about DST substring issues - is this warning sufficient, or should the code enforce it?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Doc: read_G() safety claim, Lines 87-88] **HIGH**: The comment claims safety if to_bytes() is canonical - what if this assumption is violated in practice?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Zero-length DST, Lines 49-58] **MEDIUM**: Can hash_to_F() accept empty DST? Could this collapse domain separation and allow cross-protocol forgery?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Maximum field size, Line 35] **LOW**: For curves with very large fields (e.g., 521-bit), could Repr overflow standard buffer sizes?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Minimum field size, Line 35] **LOW**: For curves with small fields (e.g., 128-bit), could brute-force attacks break discrete log security?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Null RNG, Lines 62-69] **HIGH**: What if random_nonzero_F() is called with an RNG that has no entropy? Could it produce zero repeatedly?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Read from empty stream, Lines 74-93] **LOW**: If the reader is empty, do read_F() and read_G() return IO errors or panic?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Concurrent reads, Lines 74-93] **LOW**: If multiple threads call read_F() on the same reader, could race conditions cause partial reads?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Network-specific generators, Line 47] **MEDIUM**: For privacy coins, could using the wrong generator (Bitcoin vs Monero) leak cross-chain linkability?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Hash function state, Line 40] **LOW**: Does BlockSizeUser imply that the hash state is fixed-size, or could variable-size state cause non-determinism?"
