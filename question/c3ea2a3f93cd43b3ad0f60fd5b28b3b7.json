  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Debug Assertion Bypass - High] Can the debug assertions at lines 152-153 be bypassed in release builds, allowing inconsistent verification shares or group keys to propagate to production?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Interpolation Type - Critical] Why does musig() use Interpolation::Constant(binding_factors) (line 157) instead of Lagrange interpolation? Can this be exploited to bypass threshold requirements?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [ThresholdKeys Construction - High] Can ThresholdKeys::new fail for valid inputs (line 155-161), and does error handling prevent partial key state from being observable?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Context Reuse - Critical] If the same context bytes (line 117) are reused across different validator sets or sessions, can this enable cross-session key attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Key Confirmation - High] Does musig() include any mechanism for validators to confirm that all participants computed the same group key, or can silent divergence occur?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Rogue Key Attack - Critical] Since musig() doesn't require proof-of-possession for keys, can a malicious validator provide a rogue key K = -H(L,X) * X_honest to cancel honest participants from the group key?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Context Collision - High] Can two different (network, session) pairs produce the same 32-byte context, causing key reuse across incompatible signing contexts?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Transcript Extensibility - Medium] Does the transcript format support version upgrades, or will protocol changes require hard forks to modify binding factor computation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Error Type Consistency - Low] Do all functions consistently return MusigError types, or can type coercion hide underlying DkgError details that could aid debugging?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Memory Exhaustion - Medium] Can an attacker cause repeated allocations across check_keys, binding_factor_transcript, and musig to exceed memory limits and crash validator nodes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Constant-Time Violation - Critical] Are there any variable-time operations in musig() beyond the documented multiexp_vartime that could leak private key bits?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Function] [Key Serialization - High] Do all functions use consistent key serialization via to_bytes(), or can deserialization attacks provide different keys that hash to the same bytes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Key Rotation - Critical] When validator sets rotate, can old musig() keys be reused in the new set if the same public keys participate, enabling cross-rotation attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Session Binding - High] Does the context parameter sufficiently bind keys to a specific session/network/purpose, or can keys be misused across different protocol components?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Coordinator Consistency - Critical] If different coordinators call musig() with the same inputs but receive results at different times, can race conditions cause inconsistent key state?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Processor Verification - High] Do processor nodes independently verify that musig() outputs match on-chain committed group keys, or can malicious coordinators provide fake keys?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Stake Binding - Critical] Does musig() integrate with economic security checks to ensure external funds don't exceed 33% of staked value, or is this enforced separately?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Key Confirmation Protocol - High] What on-chain mechanism confirms that all validators computed the same group key via musig(), and can Byzantine validators skip confirmation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Integration] [Batch Signing - Medium] When musig() keys are used for batch signing, can key reuse across multiple batches enable extraction of private shares?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Integer Overflow - High] In debug mode, can integer operations (e.g., i+1 at line 133) panic on overflow, causing validator DoS?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Panic Safety - Medium] Can any panic in musig() leave partially-constructed ThresholdKeys in memory that leak via panic payloads?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Unsafe Code - Critical] Does this file use any unsafe blocks (verified: none found), but do dependencies like multiexp use unsafe code that could cause undefined behavior?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Trait Implementation - Medium] Can trait implementations for MusigError (line 22-44) leak sensitive information through error messages or Debug formatting?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Deref Trait - High] Does using private_key.deref() (line 121) create additional copies of secret key material that aren't properly zeroized?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Vec Reallocation - Medium] Can Vec::extend calls in binding_factor_transcript cause multiple reallocations, leaving old transcript data in deallocated memory?"
