  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Edge Cases] [Zero Signature - Medium] Can the signing process ever produce a zero s value in the signature, and if so, is this handled correctly by Bitcoin nodes?",

  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Line 15] [DoS - Critical] The expect on x() extraction assumes the point is not at infinity, but is there any validation earlier in the call chain to guarantee this invariant?",
