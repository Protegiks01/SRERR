  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Struct: Nonce] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] Does the Nonce struct provide any mechanism to prevent reuse of nonce pairs across different signing sessions, and could nonce reuse lead to private key extraction?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Struct: Nonce] [Memory Safety - High] Are the two Zeroizing<C::F> scalars in the Nonce tuple properly zeroized on drop in all panic scenarios, or could unhandled panics leak nonce values?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Struct: Nonce] [Clone Safety - High] Does cloning a Nonce create independent copies where modifications to one don't affect the other, and are both copies properly zeroized?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Entropy - Critical] Does C::random_nonce ensure cryptographically secure randomness, and could weak RNG lead to predictable nonces enabling signature forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] Are the two calls to C::random_nonce guaranteed to produce different values, or could they theoretically return the same value compromising the binomial structure?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Secret Leakage - Critical] Does passing secret_share to C::random_nonce properly incorporate it without leaking information about the share through the nonce generation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Generator Validation - High] Is there validation that the generators slice is non-empty and contains valid curve points, or could invalid generators lead to weak commitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Generator Validation - High] Could an attacker supply the identity element as a generator, making commitments trivial and enabling forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Generator Validation - Medium] Are generators checked for small-order points that could weaken the discrete log problem?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Timing Attack - Medium] Do the scalar multiplications in the loop execute in constant time, or could timing variations leak information about nonce values?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Resource Exhaustion - Medium] Is there a limit on generators.len(), or could an attacker provide an extremely large slice causing memory exhaustion?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::new()] [Commitment Correctness - High] Are the commitments GeneratorCommitments([g * d, g * e]) correctly formed for the FROST binomial nonce structure?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: GeneratorCommitments::read()] [Malformed Input - High] Does read() validate that the two curve points are valid group elements, or could malformed input cause consensus divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: GeneratorCommitments::read()] [Subgroup Check - High] Does C::read_G perform subgroup checks, or could an attacker provide points outside the prime-order subgroup?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: GeneratorCommitments::read()] [Identity Element - Medium] Can read() accept the identity element for commitments, potentially enabling zero-nonce attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: GeneratorCommitments::read()] [IO Error Handling - Low] Are IO errors properly propagated, or could partial reads leave the struct in an inconsistent state?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: GeneratorCommitments::write()] [Serialization - Medium] Does write() produce canonical encodings, or could multiple encodings of the same point lead to transcript divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: GeneratorCommitments::write()] [IO Error - Low] If write_all fails after writing the first point, could this lead to partial commitment data being transmitted?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::read()] [Length Mismatch - High] Does read() verify that exactly generators.len() commitments are read, or could length mismatches cause panics or incorrect commitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::read()] [Index Bounds - Medium] Could the iterator 0..generators.len() combined with GeneratorCommitments::read fail with inconsistent results if generators is modified during read?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::read()] [Empty Generators - Medium] What happens if generators is empty - does this create valid but meaningless NonceCommitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::write()] [Serialization Consistency - Medium] Could partial write failures create state where some generators are written but not others, causing deserialization mismatches?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::transcript()] [Domain Separation - Critical] Is the domain_separate(b'nonce') sufficient to prevent cross-protocol attacks, or could nonces from different contexts be confused?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::transcript()] [Commitment Ordering - High] Does the transcript append commitments in a deterministic order, or could reordering lead to different binding factors for the same commitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: NonceCommitments::transcript()] [Transcript Binding - Critical] Are both D and E commitments included in the transcript, or could an attacker substitute one while keeping the other?"
