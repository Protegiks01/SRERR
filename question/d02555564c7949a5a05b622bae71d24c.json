  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Multiple Functions] [UTF-8 Validation - Low] Are all string responses properly validated as UTF-8 before processing?",
  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Function: get_block()] [Merkle Root Validation - High] Does the retrieved block have its merkle root validated against included transactions to prevent merkle tree attacks?",

  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Function: get_transaction()] [Transaction Validation - High] Does transaction retrieval validate scripts, signatures, and consensus rules, or just deserialize structure?",

  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Function: get_block_hash()] [Maximum Block Height - Low] Can requesting block heights far in the future (beyond current chain tip) cause errors or undefined behavior?",
  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Function: send_raw_transaction()] [Empty Transaction - Low] Can a transaction with no inputs or outputs be broadcast, potentially causing issues in processing logic?",

  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Function: rpc_call()] [Credential Storage - Medium] Where are basic auth credentials stored in memory, and can they leak through error messages or logs?",
  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Function: rpc_call()] [Auth Timing Attack - Low] Does the authentication mechanism have constant-time comparison to prevent timing-based credential extraction?",
  "[File: serai/networks/bitcoin/src/rpc.rs] [Multiple Functions] [Permission Model - Medium] Does the Bitcoin RPC user have minimum required permissions, or can excessive permissions increase attack surface?",
