  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Critical - Signature Forgery] Can two different protocol instances using the same transcript name but different domain separators produce colliding transcript states, allowing signature replay across FROST signing sessions? What prevents an attacker from initializing two FROST sessions with identical names?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [Critical - Cross-Protocol Attack] If domain_separate() is called with the same label in different orders during DKG vs signing, can an attacker cause transcript collision and forge threshold signatures? How is ordering enforced?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [Critical - Length Prefix Collision] The length encoding uses u64::to_le_bytes() - can an attacker craft messages where length||data collides with a different length||data pair, bypassing transcript binding in FROST nonce commitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [High - Label Collision] Can two different (label, message) pairs produce the same transcript state if the label ends with bytes that match the start of the length encoding of another message? What prevents label||length||value collision?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Type Confusion] DigestTranscriptMember variants use sequential u8 values (0-6) - can an attacker craft a message value starting with these bytes to cause type confusion between Domain and Label entries?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Medium - Protocol Confusion] If two different Serai protocols (DKG vs DEX swap signing) accidentally use the same static name bytes, can this enable cross-protocol replay attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [Medium - Insufficient Domain Separation] Is calling domain_separate() once sufficient, or can an attacker perform a meet-in-the-middle attack by manipulating subsequent append_message() calls to reach the same state?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Medium - Static Label Reuse] If the same static label is reused across different message types in FROST (e.g., 'commitment' for both nonce and binding commitments), can this weaken transcript binding?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Challenge Reuse] The comment states 'preventing the same challenge from being generated multiple times' - but if challenge() is called with the same label twice, does the Continued/Challenged fork actually prevent identical challenges, or can an attacker trigger challenge reuse in FROST?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Fork Divergence] After challenge() forks with Continued vs Challenged markers, if one validator's code accidentally clones the transcript before the fork completes, can this cause consensus divergence in DKG key generation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [High - Preimage Attack] If the underlying digest D has a preimage vulnerability, can an attacker engineer a transcript state that produces a specific challenge value, compromising FROST binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [High - Clone Safety] The implementation clones self.0 before finalizing - if the Digest implementation has non-deterministic Clone behavior, can this cause different validators to generate different challenges?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [High - Seed Truncation] rng_seed() truncates challenge output to 32 bytes - if the digest produces >32 bytes, is there bias or entropy loss that could weaken DKG secret randomness generation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - State Update Timing] If challenge() is called but the result is never used, the transcript still updates with Continued marker - can this cause unexpected state divergence if validators have different challenge call sequences?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [Medium - RNG Label Collision] The documentation warns that rng_seed(label) and challenge(label) may collide - in FROST DKG, if one validator calls challenge('nonce') and another calls rng_seed('nonce'), does this break consensus?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Length Extension Bypass] Despite the Continued/Challenged fork to prevent length extension attacks, can an attacker who controls digest padding exploit the one-byte marker to perform partial length extension?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Length Overflow] The code assumes 'messages don't exceed 16 exabytes' and uses unwrap() on u64::try_from() - what happens if a message length causes this to panic during DKG? Does this enable DoS?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SecureDigest] [High - Output Size Assumption] The SecureDigest trait requires >=256-bit output but doesn't enforce collision resistance properties - can a digest with 256-bit output but weak collision resistance break transcript binding?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Finalization State] After cloned.finalize() is called, does the digest implementation guarantee that internal state is fully consumed, or could residual state leak information?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [Medium - Endianness Consistency] Length is encoded as to_le_bytes() - if validators run on systems with different endianness interpretations in their digest implementations, can this cause consensus divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: Transcript trait] [Critical - Binding Factor Security] In FROST, binding factors are derived from transcript challenges - if append_message() is called in different orders by different validators, can this cause binding factor divergence and invalid signature aggregation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Nonce Commitment Binding] If FROST nonce commitments are bound using challenge(), but the transcript state before the challenge includes non-deterministic data, can an attacker force nonce reuse across signing sessions?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Critical - DKG Share Validation] During DKG, if participant shares are added to the transcript in non-canonical order, can this cause different validators to derive different group keys?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [High - Session Binding] If DKG sessions for different validator sets use the same domain separator, can an attacker replay DKG messages from one session into another?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [High - Proof-of-Possession Binding] If proof-of-possession challenges in DKG are generated without including the participant's identity in the transcript, can an attacker copy one participant's PoP to another?"
