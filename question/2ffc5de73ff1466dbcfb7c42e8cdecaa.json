  "[File: crypto/multiexp/src/pippenger.rs] [Function: pippenger_vartime()] [Optimization Correctness] Can the early skip at line 60 `if nibble != 0` cause incorrect results if the identity element should be explicitly accumulated in certain edge cases? (Low)",
  "[File: crypto/multiexp/src/pippenger.rs] [Function: pippenger_vartime()] [Optimization Correctness] Does the conditional intermediate_sum logic at lines 72-76 correctly handle the transition from None to Some, or can the first non-zero bucket be skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: crypto/multiexp/src/pippenger.rs] [Function: pippenger()] [Invariant Violation] Does the function maintain the mathematical invariant that result = sum(scalar[i] * point[i]) exactly, or can rounding in group operations cause drift? (Low)",

  "[File: crypto/multiexp/src/pippenger.rs] [Function: pippenger_vartime()] [Edge Case] When multiple pairs map to the same bucket at lines 61-65, does the Option handling correctly accumulate all contributions without overwriting? (Medium)",
