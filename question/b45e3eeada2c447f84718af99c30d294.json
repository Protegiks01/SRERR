  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Low - Finalize Timing] Does finalize() run in constant time, or can timing differences leak information about the final transcript state?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [Critical - Panic on Overflow] The unwrap() on u64::try_from(value.len()) will panic if length > u64::MAX - can an attacker cause this panic during DKG to force validator set divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [High - Truncation Panic] The seed.copy_from_slice(&self.challenge(label)[.. 32]) panics if challenge output < 32 bytes - can a custom digest violating SecureDigest bounds cause this?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: zeroize()] [Medium - Div Ceil Panic] The div_ceil() operation could panic on some platforms - is this safe for all possible block sizes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Low - AsRef Panic] If an AsRef<[u8]> implementation panics, this propagates to transcript operations - is this acceptable during consensus-critical operations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [High - Name Uniqueness] How is uniqueness of the &'static [u8] name enforced across different Serai protocols? Can two protocols accidentally use b'serai' and cause transcript collision?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [High - Domain Hierarchy] If domain_separate() is called multiple times, is there a hierarchical structure, or can domains be reordered to cause collision?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Medium - Label Namespace] Is there a global label namespace registry? What prevents two different FROST implementations from using the same label strings for different purposes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Challenge Label Collision] If challenge() is called with labels that are prefixes of each other (e.g., 'key' and 'key-confirmation'), can this weaken security?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 18-21] [High - Feature Parity] If MerlinTranscript is used in some contexts and DigestTranscript in others, can this cause cross-implementation attacks where the same logical transcript produces different challenges?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 18-21] [Medium - Feature Flag Safety] The merlin feature is conditional - if different validators compile with different feature flags, can this cause consensus divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 176-177] [High - Blake2b512 Assumptions] RecommendedTranscript uses Blake2b512 - if a Blake2b vulnerability is discovered, is there a migration path that doesn't break existing signatures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 176-177] [Medium - Feature Flag Dependency] RecommendedTranscript is behind the 'recommended' feature - what happens if validators deploy without this feature enabled?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Multi-Challenge Length Extension] If an attacker can influence the sequence of challenge() calls, can they perform a length extension attack across the Continued marker by predicting internal padding?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Padding Oracle] Does the digest padding interact with the custom length prefixing in a way that could enable padding oracle attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Fork Marker Collision] The Continued (5) and Challenged (6) markers are single bytes - can an attacker craft a message that ends with byte 5 or 6 to simulate a fork?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Update Atomicity] If Digest::update() is not atomic and can be interrupted, can this cause partial transcript updates that lead to state divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [High - Clone Consistency] When self.0.clone() is called, if the source and clone diverge due to internal caching, can this cause challenges to differ from continued transcripts?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Struct: DigestTranscript] [Medium - Internal State Visibility] The internal Digest state is not exposed - can this hide state corruption that would be detectable with explicit state checks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Enum: DigestTranscriptMember] [High - Enum Exhaustiveness] The enum has 7 variants (0-6) - if a future update adds variant 7, will existing signatures remain valid or will there be a hard fork?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: as_u8()] [Medium - Variant Numbering] The sequential numbering 0-6 is manually assigned - if variants are reordered in source code, will this change the u8 encoding and break compatibility?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Enum: DigestTranscriptMember] [Low - Match Exhaustiveness] The as_u8() match is exhaustive, but if compiled with different Rust versions having different match semantics, can this cause divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Memory Exhaustion] If an attacker supplies extremely large messages (approaching u64::MAX), can this cause memory exhaustion when Digest::update() buffers data?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Clone Cost DoS] If challenge() is called repeatedly and Digest cloning allocates memory, can this be used to exhaust validator memory?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: zeroize()] [Medium - Zeroization Cost] The zeroize() loop updates 2*block_size worth of data - for large block sizes, can this cause noticeable delays during consensus?"
