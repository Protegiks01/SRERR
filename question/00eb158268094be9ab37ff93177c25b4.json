  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::binding_factors()] [Unwrap Panic - High] The unwrap() will panic if binding_factors is None - could this be exploited to DoS by calling before calculate_binding_factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::binding_factors()] [Participant Existence - High] The HashMap access [&i] will panic if participant i doesn't exist - could this enable DoS attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::binding_factors()] [Reference Lifetime - Low] Does returning a slice reference create lifetime issues if the BindingFactor is modified?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Participant Lookup - High] Does bound() verify that participant l exists, or will the HashMap lookup [&l] panic?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Binding Calculation - Critical] Is the formula generator.0[0] + (generator.0[1] * rho) correctly computing D + E*ρ for FROST?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Index Synchronization - High] Does zip() ensure that nonces and binding_factors have the same length, or could length mismatch cause panics?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Iterator Index - Medium] Is the enumerate index i correctly synchronized with the generator loop, or could they get out of sync?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Point Addition - Medium] Could point addition overflow or produce invalid results for extreme binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Vector Capacity - Low] Does push() on uninitialized vectors cause multiple reallocations revealing timing information?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::bound()] [Empty Result - Medium] Could bound() return empty vectors for a participant with no nonces?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Aggregation Correctness - Critical] Does the aggregation sum(Di) + sum(Ei * ρi) correctly combine all participants' nonce commitments per FROST spec?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Identity Initialization - High] Is initializing D to C::G::identity() correct, or should it start with a different value?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Multiexp Security - High] Does multiexp_vartime provide constant-time execution, or could timing attacks leak binding factors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Generator Index - Critical] Does the indexing [n] and [g] correctly match planned_nonces structure, or could misalignment cause incorrect nonce aggregation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Participant Iteration - High] Does iterating over self.0.values() in a deterministic order, or could HashMap iteration order cause consensus issues?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Unwrap Safety - High] The unwrap() on binding_factors.as_ref().unwrap()[n] could panic if binding factors weren't calculated - DoS risk?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Index Bounds - High] Could [n] or [g] indexing go out of bounds if planned_nonces structure doesn't match stored commitments?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Capacity Preallocaton - Medium] Is with_capacity() accurately sized, or could under-allocation cause reallocations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Vector Length - Medium] Does the function verify that all participants have the same number of nonces and generators?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Empty Participants - Medium] What happens if self.0 is empty - does this return vectors of identity elements?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Function: BindingFactor::nonces()] [Multiexp Statements - High] Are the statements vector properly formed as (scalar, point) pairs for multiexp_vartime?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Cross-function] [State Management - Critical] Can commitments be inserted after binding factors are calculated, causing stale binding factors to be used?",

  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Cross-function] [Commitment Verification - High] Are there any checks that received commitments actually correspond to nonces the sender possesses?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/nonce.rs] [Cross-function] [Generator Consistency - High] Can different participants use different generator sets, and would this break the aggregation in nonces()?"
