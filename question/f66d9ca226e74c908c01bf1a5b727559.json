  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::offset()] [Multiple Offset Calls] If offset() is called multiple times, self.offset is incremented at line 415. Could this be exploited to create keys with predictable offsets? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::view()] [Offset Asymmetry] At lines 518-521, only one participant handles the offset. Could this create an asymmetric protocol where that participant has more power or information? (High)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: Interpolation::interpolation_factor()] [Constant Coefficients Validation] At line 228, constant coefficients are accessed by index. Could an attacker provide coefficients that don't sum to the expected secret? (High)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::new()] [Interpolation Type Selection] At lines 367-374, the interpolation type validation happens after parameter checks. Could an attacker bypass validation by providing unexpected interpolation types? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::write()] [Ephemeral Scalar/Offset] The comment at line 537 says scalar/offset are not serialized. Could deserializing keys and using them without re-applying scalar/offset lead to incorrect signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::read()] [Missing Validation] After deserialization at lines 625-631, are the reconstructed keys validated to ensure they match the original group_key? (High)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::read()] [Cross-Version Compatibility] Could keys serialized with one version of the code be deserialized with another version, potentially causing consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::write()] [Partial Write Failure] If writing fails partway through (e.g., at line 554), could this leave partially-written keys that deserialize incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::serialize()] [Zeroizing Vector] At line 568, the Vec is wrapped in Zeroizing. Does this ensure the serialized bytes are properly zeroized even if callers persist them? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ThresholdKeys] [Arc Thread Safety] At line 295, core is an Arc. Could concurrent access to ThresholdKeys from multiple threads cause race conditions in scalar/offset mutations? (High)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::scale()] [Non-Atomic Mutation] At lines 404-405, both scalar and offset are mutated. Could a panic between these lines leave keys in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Struct: ThresholdCore] [Shared State] The Arc wrapping at line 295 allows multiple ThresholdKeys to share the same core. Could modifications to one affect others unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: Interpolation::interpolation_factor()] [Timing Variation] At lines 229-247, the Lagrange computation has variable-time operations (loop iterations depend on included.len()). Could this leak information about the signing set? (Low)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::view()] [Secret Dependent Branches] At lines 518-520, there's a branch based on whether self.params().i() equals included[0]. Could this leak information about participant IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: Interpolation::interpolation_factor()] [Loop Iteration Count] At lines 234-242, the loop iterates over all included participants. Could the number of iterations leak information about the signing set size? (Low)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::scale()] [Zero Check Timing] At line 401, scalar.is_zero() is checked. Could this be a variable-time operation that leaks whether the scalar is zero? (Low)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::read()] [Memory Exhaustion] At lines 608-612, if n is u16::MAX (65535), reading n field elements could consume excessive memory. Is there a limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::read()] [Verification Shares Allocation] At lines 620-623, n verification shares are read into a HashMap. Could an attacker cause OOM by providing large n values? (Medium)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::new()] [Group Key Computation DoS] At lines 376-378, if t is large, summing t verification shares could be computationally expensive. Is there a limit on t? (Low)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/src/lib.rs] [Function: ThresholdKeys::view()] [View Creation Cost] At lines 500-507, interpolating verification shares for all included participants could be expensive if included.len() is close to n. Can this be DoS'd? (Low)"
