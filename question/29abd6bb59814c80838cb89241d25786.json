  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Macro: dalek_curve!] [Signature Forgery - Critical] Can the macro's conditional logic at line 32 ($chal.len() != 0) create distinct challenge computation paths between Ristretto and Ed25519 that allow cross-curve signature replay attacks when the same message and keys are used across both curves?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Macro: dalek_curve!] [Domain Separation - High] Does the empty challenge string for Ed25519 (line 47, b'') versus non-empty for Ristretto (line 44, b'chal') provide sufficient domain separation, or could an attacker construct messages that produce identical hash inputs across curves?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Macro: dalek_curve!] [Side-Channel - High] Does the conditional branch at line 32 checking $chal.len() != 0 create a timing side-channel that leaks which curve is being used during signature verification, potentially allowing curve identification attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Macro: dalek_curve!] [Type Safety - Medium] Can the macro's use of generic parameters $Curve, $Hram allow incorrect type instantiation where the Hram implementation is paired with the wrong curve type, leading to cryptographic mismatches?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Macro: dalek_curve!] [Const Correctness - Medium] Is the CONTEXT constant at line 22 properly bound to prevent runtime modification or reinterpretation that could break domain separation across different FROST instances?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Signature Forgery - Critical] Can an attacker manipulate the message bytes 'm' to inject additional context or challenge bytes that would be misinterpreted by the hash concatenation at line 36, causing the challenge scalar to be computed incorrectly?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Malleability - Critical] Does the hash input concatenation at lines 33 and 36 allow malleability where an attacker can construct different (R, A, m) tuples that produce the same challenge scalar, enabling signature forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] If two different messages produce colliding challenge values due to weak domain separation in the hash concatenation, could this enable private key recovery through nonce reuse detection across multiple signatures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Point Validation - Critical] Does the function assume that R and A are valid curve points? If compress() is called on identity or invalid points, could this produce predictable or zero challenge scalars that enable signature forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Bias in Challenge - High] Does Scalar::from_hash at line 35 properly perform wide reduction to eliminate bias? If the reduction is biased, could an attacker exploit this to create challenges in a restricted subset of the scalar field?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Hash Collision - High] If the hash function H produces a collision for two different concatenations at line 36, could an attacker forge signatures by finding colliding (R, A, m) inputs?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Length Extension - High] Does the concatenation at line 36 using .concat() prevent length extension attacks where an attacker appends data to one component that gets interpreted as part of another component?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Zero Challenge - High] Can the function ever return a zero scalar challenge? If so, would this leak the private key through the Schnorr equation s = r + c*a where c=0 means s=r?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Encoding Ambiguity - High] Does compress().to_bytes() produce canonical encodings? Could non-canonical point encodings for the same point produce different challenges, enabling signature malleability?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Order Dependency - Medium] Is the order of concatenation (R, A, m) at line 36 consistent with IETF FROST specification? Could reversing this order in some contexts cause signature incompatibility or security issues?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Constant: CONTEXT] [Domain Separation - Critical] Can the CONTEXT strings 'FROST-RISTRETTO255-SHA512-v1' and 'FROST-ED25519-SHA512-v1' collide with any other protocol using similar naming, allowing cross-protocol signature replay attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Constant: CONTEXT] [Versioning - High] Do the version suffixes '-v1' in CONTEXT strings provide forward compatibility? If FROST v2 is introduced, could v1 signatures be replayed as v2 signatures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 33] [Concatenation - High] Does the concatenation [$CONTEXT.as_ref(), $chal].concat() at line 33 properly delimit the two byte strings to prevent ambiguity where CONTEXT ending bytes could be interpreted as challenge bytes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 33] [Conditional Hashing - Medium] Does the conditional at line 32 checking $chal.len() != 0 create different hash pre-images for Ed25519 vs Ristretto? Could this be exploited to cause consensus divergence in a multi-curve deployment?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 33] [String Lifetime - Medium] Is CONTEXT guaranteed to be a 'static lifetime? Could there be scenarios where CONTEXT is deallocated or modified during hash computation, causing memory unsafety?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [Scalar Reduction - Critical] Does Scalar::from_hash perform a wide reduction modulo the curve order? If it uses narrow reduction or truncation, could this create bias that reduces signature security from 256 bits to fewer effective bits?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [Hash Output Size - High] Is the hash output size (SHA-512 = 64 bytes) sufficient for wide reduction? If from_hash expects a different size, could this cause truncation or padding that introduces bias?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [Modular Reduction - High] If from_hash uses barrett or montgomery reduction, are these implementations constant-time? Timing variations could leak information about the challenge scalar magnitude?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35-36] [Input Handling - Medium] Does from_hash properly handle the finalized hash digest? Could there be ownership or lifetime issues where the hash is used after being consumed by chain_update?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Chain Update - Medium] Does chain_update consume the hasher? If not, could the same hasher be accidentally reused for multiple challenge computations, causing challenge collisions?"
