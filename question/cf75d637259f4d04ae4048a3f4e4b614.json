  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Memory Safety] [Stack Safety - Low] Can deeply nested signing operations cause stack overflow when processing many concurrent signatures?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Bitcoin Integration] [Address Derivation - Critical] When x_only() is used to derive Bitcoin addresses, does the system verify that the resulting address is spendable by the threshold key before accepting deposits?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Bitcoin Integration] [Signature Broadcast - High] If a signature is successfully created by verify() but fails Bitcoin network validation, can this cause fund loss or require emergency key rotation?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Bitcoin Integration] [Network Compatibility - Medium] Are there any Bitcoin network upgrades (Taproot, future soft forks) that could break the BIP-340 signature format or validation logic used here?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Coordinator] [Message Ordering - High] Does the signing protocol enforce that signature shares arrive in a consistent order across all validators to prevent race conditions in share aggregation?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Coordinator] [Batch Signing - High] When signing multiple transactions in a batch, does each signature use fresh nonces, or can nonce reuse across batch items expose keys?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Processor] [Retry Logic - Medium] If signing fails and is retried, are new nonces generated for the retry, or can retry attempts reuse failed nonces leading to key exposure?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Validator Sets] [Key Rotation - Critical] During validator set rotation, if both old and new sets can sign with this algorithm, can an attacker get signatures from both sets for the same transaction leading to double-spends?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Validator Sets] [Threshold Changes - High] If the threshold t changes during a signing session, can this cause some validators to compute different binding factors or challenges, breaking signature aggregation?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Validator Sets] [Participant Dropout - Medium] If some participants fail during sign_share() after others have already committed nonces, does the protocol handle nonce abortion securely without leaking key material?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Dependencies] [k256 Vulnerabilities - Critical] If the k256 elliptic curve library has a vulnerability in point operations or scalar arithmetic, how would this manifest in signature forgery or key extraction?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Dependencies] [FROST Library - Critical] Does the wrapped FROST algorithm implementation have its own security audits, or are there unknown vulnerabilities in the threshold signing logic?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Dependencies] [Version Pinning - High] Are all cryptographic dependencies pinned to specific audited versions, or can automatic updates introduce breaking changes or vulnerabilities?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Dependencies] [Subtle Library - Medium] Does the subtle crate's constant-time primitives actually guarantee constant-time execution on all target platforms and compiler optimization levels?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Transcript] [Transcript Binding - Critical] Is the FROST transcript properly bound to session identifiers, participant sets, and network context to prevent cross-session or cross-network replay?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Transcript] [Fiat-Shamir - High] Does the transcript-based challenge generation follow the Fiat-Shamir transform correctly, including proper domain separation for all transcript entries?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Transcript] [Transcript Reset - Medium] Can the transcript state be reset or manipulated between signing sessions to cause nonce or challenge reuse?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Testing] [Edge Cases - High] Are there tests validating behavior with edge case inputs like points at infinity, zero scalars, or maximum scalar values?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Testing] [Bitcoin Compatibility - High] Does the test suite verify that generated signatures are actually valid on a Bitcoin testnet node, not just mathematically correct?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Testing] [Malicious Participants - Medium] Are there tests simulating malicious participants who provide invalid shares, wrong nonces, or attempt to bias the group key?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Attack Vector] [Wagner's Attack - High] Is the FROST nonce commitment scheme resistant to Wagner's generalized birthday attack for k-sum problems?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Attack Vector] [Chosen Message - Medium] Can an attacker who controls the message content (e.g., through instruction manipulation) exploit specific message values to bias challenges or reduce signature security?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Attack Vector] [Grinding Attack - Low] Can an attacker grind through many signing attempts to find specific R values that produce signatures with exploitable properties?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Attack Vector] [Parallel Sessions - Medium] If multiple signing sessions run in parallel, can nonce leakage or state confusion between sessions compromise key security?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Type Safety] [Choice Type - Low] Is the Choice type from subtle properly handled to prevent accidental conversion to bool in ways that break constant-time guarantees?"
