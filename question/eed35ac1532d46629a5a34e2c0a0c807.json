  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Clone during operations, Line 31] **MEDIUM**: If a ciphersuite is cloned mid-operation (e.g., during hashing), could internal state be corrupted?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Edge: Partial reads with errors, Lines 76-93] **MEDIUM**: If read_exact() partially succeeds then errors, is the partial data zeroized before returning the error?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Multiple ciphersuites simultaneously, Lines 30-102] **HIGH**: If a validator uses multiple ciphersuites (Bitcoin + Ethereum), could cross-suite data confusion occur?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Version upgrades, Line 43] **HIGH**: During a protocol upgrade, if ID values change, could old signatures become invalid, freezing funds?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Test vectors, Lines 49-101] **MEDIUM**: Are there test vectors to verify that different ciphersuite implementations produce identical results?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Security: Constant-time guarantees, Lines 66-97] **HIGH**: Beyond specific functions, is there a global constant-time guarantee for all ciphersuite operations?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Security: Side-channel audits, Lines 30-102] **MEDIUM**: Has this ciphersuite trait been audited for cache-timing and power analysis attacks?",
