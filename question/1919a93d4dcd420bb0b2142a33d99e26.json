  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Logic Error] Can the validation pass when map.len() + 1 equals included.len() but 'ours' is NOT in the included list, allowing invalid participant configurations that could enable unauthorized signing sessions?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Participant Validation] Does the function correctly handle the case where 'ours' appears multiple times in the 'included' slice, potentially allowing duplicate participant handling and threshold bypass?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Off-by-One] The check (map.len() + 1) != included.len() assumes exactly one participant (ours) is missing from the map - could this be exploited if the included list is maliciously constructed with duplicates that pass earlier checks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Race Condition] If validate_map is called concurrently with the same 'ours' parameter but different maps and included lists, could this lead to inconsistent validation states in the signing protocol?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Denial of Service] Can an attacker provide an extremely large 'included' slice causing the iteration at line 59 to consume excessive CPU, especially when called repeatedly during signing rounds?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Medium - Integer Overflow] Could map.len() + 1 overflow if map.len() equals usize::MAX, causing incorrect validation results before reaching the comparison at line 55?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Logic Bypass] The function checks if 'ours' is in the map at line 61 and returns DuplicatedParticipant error, but what if 'ours' is not in 'included' at all - does this allow bypassing threshold requirements?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Participant Forgery] If the HashMap contains a key equal to 'ours' due to Participant trait implementation issues or hash collisions, could line 61-62 incorrectly reject valid signing sessions?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Medium - Error Information Leak] Do the error messages at lines 56, 62, 68 leak sensitive information about participant configuration that could aid in timing attacks or participant enumeration?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Missing Validation] Does validate_map verify that all participants in 'included' are unique before the iteration at line 59, or could duplicate entries in 'included' bypass the threshold check?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - HashMap Attack] Could an attacker craft Participant values that cause hash collisions in the HashMap at line 61 and 67, leading to incorrect validation results?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Threshold Bypass] If 'included' contains fewer than threshold participants but includes duplicates of 'ours', could the length check at line 55 pass while actual unique participants are below threshold?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - State Inconsistency] When validate_map returns an error, is there any cleanup or state invalidation required, or could partial validation states be exploited in subsequent calls?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Medium - Type Safety] Does the Participant type guarantee uniqueness and ordering properties required for the validation logic, or could custom Participant implementations break the validation?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Continue Logic] The 'continue' at line 64 skips validation for 'ours' - if 'ours' appears multiple times in 'included', does each occurrence trigger 'continue', potentially hiding duplicate participant issues?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Missing Bounds Check] Does the function validate that participants in 'included' are within valid bounds (e.g., 1 <= participant <= n) before using them, or is this assumed to be done elsewhere?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Medium - Generic Type T] The generic type T in the HashMap<Participant, T> is unconstrained - could malicious T types with custom Drop implementations cause issues during validation failures?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Error Propagation] The function uses Err(...) followed by '?' at lines 56, 62, 68 - could this error propagation pattern leak information or leave the system in an inconsistent state?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Empty Included List] What happens if 'included' is empty? Does map.len() + 1 == 0 pass the check at line 55, potentially allowing signing with no participants?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Participant Ordering] Does the function assume any specific ordering of participants in 'included', and could incorrect ordering lead to signature malleability or replay attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Medium - Error Handling] Does the InternalError variant at line 30 expose implementation details through the &'static str that could aid attackers in understanding system internals?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [High - Participant Bounds] The InvalidParticipant error at lines 32-33 includes the expected n and actual participant - could this reveal threshold configuration details to unauthorized parties?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Critical - Missing Error Types] Are there missing error variants for critical failures like nonce reuse, key compromise detection, or cryptographic verification failures that should be distinguished from InvalidPreprocess/InvalidShare?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Medium - Error Clone] FrostError derives Clone at line 27 - could cloning errors containing sensitive participant information lead to information leakage across thread boundaries?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Low - Error Display] Do the error display implementations leak timing information through variable-length error messages that could be exploited in remote timing attacks?"
