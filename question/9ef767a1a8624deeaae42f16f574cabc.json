  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 28-39] [Trait Hram - Medium] Does the Hram trait require Send + Sync bounds? In multi-threaded FROST signing, could race conditions occur if Hram state is shared across threads?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 30] [Lifetime Parameters - Low] Are there hidden lifetime parameters in the references &C::G for R and A that could cause use-after-free if these references are invalidated during hash computation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 30] [Type Aliasing - Low] Does the type alias Scalar from dalek_ff_group::Scalar have different properties than expected? Could this cause subtle type mismatches with other FROST code?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 31] [Hash Algorithm - High] The code uses <$Curve as Ciphersuite>::H which should be SHA-512 for both curves. Is this guaranteed? Could a misconfiguration use a weaker hash like SHA-256 that doesn't provide 256-bit security?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 31] [Hash Initialization - Medium] Does H::new() properly initialize the hash state? Could uninitialized state from previous computations leak into the hash?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 31-36] [Hash Finalization - Medium] Is the hash properly finalized before passing to from_hash? Could partial hash state be used that doesn't include all input bytes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 31] [Hash Collision Resistance - Medium] Does SHA-512 provide sufficient collision resistance for the security level (256 bits)? Birthday attacks on the challenge space could reduce effective security?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 44] [IETF Compliance - High] The CONTEXT string includes 'IETF' prefix via IetfRistrettoHram. Does the implementation fully comply with IETF draft-irtf-cfrg-frost? Deviations could break interoperability or introduce vulnerabilities?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 47] [Ed25519 IETF - High] For Ed25519, the empty $chal parameter differs from Ristretto. Is this consistent with RFC 8032 and IETF FROST? Inconsistencies could break compatibility with other implementations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 33] [Challenge Prefix - Medium] The IETF spec may require specific prefixes for challenge computation. Does prepending [$CONTEXT, $chal] match the spec exactly? Off-by-one errors in prefix length could cause incompatibility?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [H2 Function - Medium] The IETF FROST spec defines H2 as the challenge hash function. Does this hram() implementation match H2's requirements including input encoding and domain separation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Memory DoS - Medium] Could an attacker provide an extremely large message m that causes the concat() operation to allocate excessive memory, leading to OOM and DoS?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Hash DoS - Low] Could repeatedly calling hram() with varying inputs cause excessive CPU usage for hash computation? Are there rate limits on challenge computation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [from_hash Performance - Low] Does Scalar::from_hash perform expensive modular reduction? In high-throughput signing, could this become a bottleneck that affects performance?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Panic Conditions - Medium] Does compress() or to_bytes() ever panic? If R or A are invalid, could this cause validator DoS during FROST signing?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [from_hash Panic - Medium] Could Scalar::from_hash panic on malformed hash output? This would be critical in a consensus context where panics cause chain halts?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 33] [Concat Panic - Low] Could the .concat() operation panic on allocation failure? In resource-constrained environments, this could cause signing failures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Lines 44, 47] [Cross-Curve - Critical] Given that Ristretto and Ed25519 share the same underlying Curve25519, could an attacker exploit mathematical relationships between the curves to transfer signatures or keys from one curve to the other?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Lines 44, 47] [Context Collision - High] Are the CONTEXT strings sufficiently different to prevent any collision in the hash space that could allow cross-curve signature replay?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Group Isomorphism - Medium] Since Ristretto is a quotient group of Ed25519, could the isomorphism be exploited to create valid challenges in one curve that verify in the other?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 30] [Parameter Binding - High] Are R, A, and m cryptographically bound in the hash input such that no component can be substituted without detection? Weak binding could enable forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Session Binding - Medium] Does the challenge computation bind to a specific FROST session ID or network identifier? Without session binding, signatures from test networks could be replayed on mainnet?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 22] [CONTEXT Binding - Medium] Is the CONTEXT constant used consistently across all FROST operations (DKG, signing, verification)? Inconsistent context usage could break binding and enable attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [Scalar Range - High] Does the challenge scalar have the full range [0, L) where L is the curve order? Restricted ranges could reduce security?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [Modular Arithmetic - Medium] Are scalar operations (implicit in FROST signing equation) properly reduced modulo the curve order? Improper reduction could cause signature verification failures?"
