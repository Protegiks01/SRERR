  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/mod.rs] [Function: Scanner::scan_transaction()] [Medium - Output Index Overflow] Line 203 casts vout from usize to u32 - on a 32-bit system, could a legitimate vout > u32::MAX be missed? (Medium)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: SignableTransaction::calculate_weight_vbytes()] [Low - Sequence Number] Line 79 uses Sequence::MAX - does this match what the actual transaction uses, or could sequence number encoding affect weight? (Low)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: SignableTransaction::new()] [Medium - LockTime] Line 248 uses LockTime::ZERO - could this prevent RBF or other Bitcoin features that require non-zero locktime? (Medium)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: TransactionSignMachine::sign()] [Critical - Commitment Mismatch] If validators have different views of prevouts at line 375 due to reorgs or fork detection lag, could they produce incompatible signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/mod.rs] [Function: Scanner::new()] [High - Scanner Initialization Race] If different validators call Scanner::new with slightly different keys due to timing, could they scan different addresses and miss deposits? (High)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/mod.rs] [Function: ReceivedOutput::clone()] [Medium - Deep Clone] ReceivedOutput derives Clone at line 89 - do output and outpoint properly deep clone, or could shared references cause use-after-free? (Medium)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: SignableTransaction::new()] [Low - Vec Reallocation] Multiple Vec operations at lines 188-202 could cause multiple reallocations - is this a DoS vector for very large transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/mod.rs] [Function: tweak_keys()] [High - BIP-341 Compliance] The comment at line 48 references BIP-341 but doesn't cite a specific version - if BIP-341 is updated, could the implementation become non-compliant? (High)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: SignableTransaction::calculate_weight_vbytes()] [Medium - BIP-141 Compliance] The vbytes calculation references BIP-141 at line 106-107 - does this exactly match Bitcoin Core's implementation or could subtle differences cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/mod.rs] [Function: Scanner::register_offset()] [Critical - Script Collision] If two different offsets increment to the same even point at lines 184-195, they produce the same script - this violates uniqueness and could cause funds to be credited to the wrong account. (Critical)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: SignableTransaction::new()] [Critical - Input Value Overflow] Line 175 sums input values with .sum::<u64>() - if multiple large inputs cause overflow, the sum wraps and NotEnoughFunds check at line 215 could pass incorrectly. (Critical)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Function: TransactionSignatureMachine::complete()] [Critical - Malleability After Signing] After complete() returns the signed Transaction at line 427, could an attacker modify witnesses to create a different txid while keeping signatures valid? (Critical)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/mod.rs] [Cross-Module] [High - Crypto Module Dependency] The wallet depends on crypto::x_only and crypto::needs_negation - if the crypto module has bugs, could incorrect point validation propagate to all wallet operations? (High)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Cross-Module] [Critical - FROST Protocol Dependency] The transaction signing uses frost::sign::* primitives - if the FROST implementation has vulnerabilities (e.g., weak nonce generation), could this compromise all Bitcoin transactions? (Critical)",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/wallet/send.rs] [Constant: DUST] [High - DUST Constant Accuracy] DUST is hardcoded to 546 at line 32, but the comment mentions it varies by output type - could Taproot outputs have a different dust limit that's not enforced? (High)"
