  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Compression - Critical] Does compress() on R and A guarantee canonical encoding? Could low-order points or points with multiple encodings produce different challenge scalars for equivalent signatures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Identity Point - Critical] What happens if R or A is the identity point? Does compress().to_bytes() produce a well-defined output that prevents zero or predictable challenge scalars?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Torsion Points - High] If R or A includes small-order torsion components, does compression eliminate these? Failing to do so could enable attacks through torsion points that bypass signature verification?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Ed25519 Malleability - High] For Ed25519, does compress() handle the sign bit correctly? Non-canonical representations with flipped signs could produce different challenges for mathematically equivalent points?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Cofactor - Medium] For Ed25519 which has cofactor 8, does the implementation properly handle cofactor clearing? Could small-order components in R or A leak through and affect the challenge?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Boundary Ambiguity - High] Does the three-way concatenation [&R.compress().to_bytes(), &A.compress().to_bytes(), m].concat() have unambiguous boundaries? Could an attacker craft messages where R bytes blend into A bytes or A bytes blend into message?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Fixed vs Variable - High] Are R and A fixed-length (32 bytes for both curves)? If message m is also 32 bytes, could there be confusion about which 32-byte chunk is which component?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Allocation - Medium] Does .concat() allocate new memory? Could this cause performance issues or DoS in high-throughput signing scenarios where memory pressure causes failures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Zeroization - Medium] After concat() creates the combined byte array, are sensitive components (especially from m if it contains secrets) properly zeroized after hashing?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 36] [Endianness - Low] Does to_bytes() use consistent endianness? Could big-endian vs little-endian differences between platforms cause incompatible challenge computations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 43-44] [Feature Flag - Medium] If both 'ristretto' and 'ed25519' features are enabled, are there naming collisions or type ambiguities that could cause the wrong Hram implementation to be used?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 43-44] [Conditional Compilation - Medium] Could build configurations exist where neither feature is enabled, causing compilation to succeed but no Hram implementation to be available, leading to runtime linking errors?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 43, 46] [Feature Consistency - Medium] If code instantiates FROST with one curve type but links against a binary compiled with a different feature flag, could type confusion occur where Ristretto signatures are verified as Ed25519 or vice versa?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 44, 47] [Naming Convention - Low] The Hram types are named IetfRistrettoHram and IetfEd25519Hram. Could user code accidentally import and use the wrong one for a given curve, causing verification failures or worse?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Binding Factor - High] In FROST, the challenge must incorporate binding factors. Does this hram() implementation expect binding factors to be pre-mixed into the message m, or are they handled separately? Missing binding factors could enable rogue-key attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Threshold Context - High] Does hram() incorporate any threshold-specific parameters (t, n, participant IDs)? Omitting these could allow signature shares from one session to be replayed in another session with different thresholds?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Key Commitment - High] Does the public key A passed to hram() represent the group public key or an individual verification share? Using the wrong key type could break signature aggregation or enable forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Message Transcript - Medium] Should the message m already include transcript commitments to all participants' nonce commitments? If not, could nonce commitment manipulation enable attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Preprocessing Reuse - Medium] If nonce R is reused across multiple messages (preprocessing reuse attack), does the challenge computation detect this? Reusing R with different messages would leak the private key?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Constant-Time - High] Are the compress(), to_bytes(), and concat() operations constant-time with respect to the point coordinates? Timing variations could leak information about R or A?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Cache Timing - Medium] Does the hash.update() or hash.chain_update() implementation use lookup tables that could be vulnerable to cache-timing attacks, leaking information about the input bytes?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 32] [Branch Timing - Medium] Does the conditional check $chal.len() != 0 create observable timing differences between Ristretto (branch taken) and Ed25519 (branch not taken) that could be used to fingerprint which curve is in use?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 35] [Scalar Reduction Timing - Medium] Does Scalar::from_hash use constant-time modular reduction? Variable-time reduction could leak high bits of the hash output?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Function: hram()] [Power Analysis - Low] In hardware security module (HSM) deployments, could power analysis during hash computation or scalar reduction leak information about R, A, or m?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/frost/src/curve/dalek.rs] [Line 21-23] [Trait Implementation - Medium] Does the Curve trait implementation require additional safety invariants beyond providing CONTEXT? Could a malicious implementor provide an empty or colliding CONTEXT that breaks domain separation?"
