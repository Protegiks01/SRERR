  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: zeroize()] [Medium - Stack Spillage] The finalized challenge in mark_read() is stack-allocated - can this spill sensitive data to stack memory that isn't zeroized?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Low - Return Value Cleanup] The challenge Output<D> is returned directly - is it the caller's responsibility to zeroize it, or can it leak?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Struct: DigestTranscript] [High - Cross-Version Compatibility] If different Serai validators run different versions of this code, and the append() or challenge() logic changes, can this cause consensus failure?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Fork Compatibility] If a hard fork changes the Continued/Challenged marker bytes, will old signatures remain valid?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Transcript] [Critical - Message Ordering in DKG] During FROST DKG Round 2, if participants append their commitments in different orders, can this cause different group keys?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Nonce Reuse Prevention] If FROST nonce generation uses rng_seed() with insufficient binding to message/session, can nonce reuse occur?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [High - DKG Blame Protocol] During DKG, if blame data is added to the transcript, can an attacker manipulate the order to frame innocent participants?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [High - Key Rotation Binding] If validator set rotations reuse transcripts without proper domain separation by epoch, can old key material leak into new sessions?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Proof-of-Possession Uniqueness] Can two participants generate identical proof-of-possession challenges if their IDs are not bound?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Zero-Length Messages] If append() is called with an empty slice, does the length prefix (8 bytes of zeros) still provide sufficient domain separation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Medium - Null Label] If label is empty (&[]), can this cause label collision with zero-length domain separators?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Empty Transcript Challenge] If challenge() is called immediately after new() without any messages, is the challenge sufficiently unpredictable?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [Low - Seed Reuse] If rng_seed() is called multiple times with the same label, is each output independent?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Struct: DigestTranscript] [Medium - No Serialization] DigestTranscript doesn't implement Serialize/Deserialize - if a protocol tries to checkpoint transcript state, can this introduce vulnerabilities?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Type: Challenge] [Low - Challenge Serialization] If challenge outputs need to be transmitted over the network, is there a canonical serialization format?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [High - Length Prefix DoS] An attacker supplying a message with length near u64::MAX forces 8 bytes of length encoding - can rapid calls with varying lengths cause CPU DoS?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: zeroize()] [Medium - Drop Performance] If DigestTranscript is dropped frequently (e.g., after each signing operation), can the zeroize() cost impact performance?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SecureDigest] [High - Algorithm Downgrade] If a protocol supports multiple digest algorithms, can an attacker force use of a weaker (but still >=256-bit) digest?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 176-177] [Medium - Hardcoded Algorithm] RecommendedTranscript hardcodes Blake2b512 - if migration to a new algorithm is needed, what's the migration path?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Critical - Serai Protocol Identifier] Does each Serai sub-protocol (DKG, signing, batch verification, DEX) use a unique name parameter to prevent cross-protocol attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [Critical - Network Identifier Binding] Is the network ID (Bitcoin/Ethereum/Monero) bound via domain_separate() in every transcript to prevent cross-chain replay?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Critical - Validator Set ID Binding] Is the current validator set ID bound to every transcript to prevent replay from old sets?",
