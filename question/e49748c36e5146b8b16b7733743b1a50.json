  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Memory: Type G, Line 37] **MEDIUM**: Does Zeroize on G properly clear all point coordinates, including any cached precomputation tables used for scalar multiplication?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Panic: read_F(), Line 76] **MEDIUM**: If read_exact() panics due to unexpected EOF, could unhandled panics during batch processing leave the validator in an inconsistent state?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Panic: read_G(), Line 93] **MEDIUM**: Same panic risk as read_F() - could panics during key confirmation cause some validators to accept and others to reject the same key?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Panic: random_nonzero_F(), Lines 64-67] **LOW**: The while loop - could integer overflow in loop counter (if that exists) cause a panic?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Error: read_F(), Line 80] **LOW**: The error message uses io::Error::other() - is this the correct error type, or could it be confused with actual IO errors?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Error: read_G(), Lines 96-99] **LOW**: Two different error paths ('invalid point' vs 'non-canonical point') - could distinguishing them leak information?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Consensus: hash_to_F(), Lines 49-58] **CRITICAL**: If different validators use different ciphersuite implementations with different hash_to_F() behaviors, could they compute different challenge values and reject each other's signatures?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Consensus: read_F(), Lines 74-83] **HIGH**: The canonicalization check relies on from_repr() returning Option::None for non-canonical values - what if implementations differ on what's canonical?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Consensus: read_G(), Lines 91-101] **HIGH**: The to_bytes() round-trip check assumes deterministic serialization - could floating-point-style non-determinism break this?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Consensus: generator(), Line 47] **HIGH**: If generator() is not deterministic across platforms, could validators generate different threshold keys for the same session?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Consensus: ID, Line 43] **MEDIUM**: If different validator binaries use different ID values for the same curve, would they reject each other's signatures as invalid?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [DoS: random_nonzero_F(), Lines 64-67] **MEDIUM**: Could an adversary who controls the RNG force the rejection sampling loop to run indefinitely, causing validator DoS?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [DoS: hash_to_F(), Lines 49-58] **LOW**: Could extremely large DST or msg inputs cause memory exhaustion when hashing during batch processing?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [DoS: read_G(), Line 95] **MEDIUM**: Could crafted point encodings that are expensive to decode (but still valid) cause CPU exhaustion during key confirmation?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [DoS: read_F(), Line 79] **LOW**: Could repeatedly submitting non-canonical scalars cause validators to waste CPU checking and rejecting them?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [FROST: hash_to_F() DST collision, Lines 49-58] **CRITICAL**: In FROST, could DST='FROST-nonce'||session_id collide with DST='FROST'||'-nonce'||session_id, allowing nonce reuse across sessions?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [FROST: generator() consistency, Line 47] **CRITICAL**: If different validators use different generators due to ciphersuite version mismatch, would the aggregated threshold key be invalid?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [DKG: read_G() for key shares, Lines 91-101] **CRITICAL**: If a validator submits a maliciously crafted key share that passes read_G() checks but is actually the identity point in disguise, could the aggregated key be breakable?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [DKG: random_nonzero_F() for secrets, Lines 62-69] **CRITICAL**: If the DKG uses random_nonzero_F() to generate secret polynomial coefficients, could RNG prediction allow an attacker to learn all shares?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [MuSig: hash_to_F() for key aggregation, Lines 49-58] **HIGH**: In MuSig-style key confirmation, if hash_to_F() is used to compute aggregation coefficients, could DST manipulation create rogue-key attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Type: Repr, Lines 75-93] **MEDIUM**: The Repr::default() calls - do they guarantee zero-initialized buffers? Could uninitialized memory leak into read operations?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Type: Option, Lines 79-95] **LOW**: The Option::<T>::from() conversions - could the None case leave partial data in the Option's discriminant?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Type: Choice, Line 66] **MEDIUM**: The Choice type from subtle - does its conversion to bool preserve constant-time properties on all platforms?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Generic: <R: Read>, Lines 74-93] **LOW**: Could malicious Read implementations return partial data or hang indefinitely, breaking read_F() and read_G()?",
  "[File: crypto/ciphersuite/src/lib.rs] [Crypto: Field modulus, Line 35] **HIGH**: Does PrimeField guarantee that the modulus is actually prime? Could composite moduli break discrete log security?"
