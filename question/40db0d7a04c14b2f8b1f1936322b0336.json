  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::new()] [Transcript Binding - High] Does Schnorr::new() properly initialize the IETF transcript for the signing session, or can transcripts from different sessions be confused, leading to cross-session signature replay?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::new()] [State Initialization - Medium] Can Schnorr::new() be called multiple times for the same signing session, potentially causing transcript state corruption or nonce reuse if the FrostSchnorr state is not properly isolated?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::transcript()] [Transcript Binding - Critical] Does the transcript() method ensure that all validators use identical transcript state when computing binding factors, or can divergent transcripts cause different challenge computations?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::transcript()] [Replay Attack - High] Can an attacker manipulate the transcript state through transcript() to cause the same nonce commitments to be used across multiple signing sessions, enabling key recovery?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::nonces()] [Information Leak - Medium] Does nonces() expose committed nonce values before the signing protocol completes, potentially allowing an attacker to abort selectively based on nonce knowledge?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::nonces()] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] Can the nonces() method return the same nonce values if called multiple times, and if so, could this cause nonce reuse if a participant crashes and restarts during signing?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::preprocess_addendum()] [Nonce Generation - Critical] Does preprocess_addendum() ensure cryptographically secure nonce generation using the provided RNG, or can weak randomness in the RNG lead to predictable nonces and private key extraction?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::preprocess_addendum()] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] If preprocess_addendum() is called multiple times with the same RNG state, can this cause nonce reuse across different signing sessions, exposing the private key?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::preprocess_addendum()] [DoS - Medium] Can a malicious validator cause preprocess_addendum() to generate invalid nonces that will later cause panics in x() or x_only() when aggregated?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::sign_share()] [Signature Forgery - Critical] Does sign_share() properly validate that the nonce_sums provided are legitimate aggregates of all participants' nonces, or can a malicious coordinator inject false nonce sums to manipulate the signature shares?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::sign_share()] [Key Extraction - Critical] If sign_share() uses nonces that haven't been properly validated for uniqueness, can an attacker collect multiple signature shares with the same nonce to extract the participant's secret key share?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::sign_share()] [Nonce Reuse - Critical] Does sign_share() mark nonces as consumed after use to prevent accidental reuse if the function is called twice for the same signing session?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::sign_share()] [Binding Factor - High] Does sign_share() correctly compute and apply the FROST binding factor from the transcript to prevent rogue-key attacks during threshold signing?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::sign_share()] [Challenge Reuse - Medium] If the same message msg is signed multiple times, does sign_share() ensure different nonces are used each time, or can challenge reuse leak key material?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Signature Malleability - Critical] In the verify() function, the signature s is conditionally negated based on needs_negation(&sig.R). Can an attacker exploit this to create two different valid signatures (s and -s) for the same message, breaking transaction uniqueness assumptions?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [DoS - Critical] If verify() is called with a group_key at the point at infinity, will it panic inside the underlying verification logic, causing validator crashes during batch transaction validation?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Signature Forgery - High] Does verify() properly validate that the sum scalar represents a valid aggregation of t-of-n shares, or can fewer than threshold participants forge a valid signature by manipulating the sum?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [BIP-340 Compliance - Critical] The verify() function drops the first byte of the FROST signature [1..] to convert to Bitcoin format. Can this truncation introduce edge cases where a FROST-valid signature becomes Bitcoin-invalid or vice versa?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Timing Attack - High] Does the conditional_select() operation for negating s execute in constant time, or can an attacker use timing side-channels to determine the nonce's Y-coordinate parity and reduce the signature search space?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Array Bounds - Medium] The [1..].try_into().unwrap() slice operation assumes the FROST signature is at least 65 bytes. Can a malformed signature cause an out-of-bounds panic here?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Consensus Bug - Critical] If different validators compute different values for needs_negation(&sig.R) due to library version differences, they will produce different signature bytes, causing consensus failure on which signature is valid?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Replay Attack - Medium] Does verify() ensure that the nonces used are session-unique, or can an attacker replay old nonce commitments to force signature reuse across different transactions?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Fund Loss - High] If verify() returns None due to verification failure but the calling code doesn't handle this properly, could this result in a transaction being considered signed when it actually failed verification?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify()] [Mathematical Error - Medium] Does the negation of sum to -sum preserve the mathematical correctness of the BIP-340 verification equation s*G = R + c*A?",
  "[File: networks/bitcoin/src/crypto.rs] [Function: Schnorr::verify_share()] [Signature Forgery - Critical] Does verify_share() properly validate that each participant's share is computed correctly before aggregation, or can a malicious participant submit an invalid share that passes verification but corrupts the final signature?"
