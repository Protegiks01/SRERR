  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Algorithm Selection] [High - Algorithm Binding] How does lib.rs ensure that the Algorithm used for signing matches the algorithm committed to during DKG? Could algorithm substitution attacks occur?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Integration: Multi-Protocol] [High - Context Separation] Does lib.rs enforce context separation when FROST is used for multiple protocols simultaneously, preventing cross-protocol replay attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Zero Threshold] If ThresholdParams allows t=0 or t=1, does validate_map handle these degenerate cases safely, or could single-signer scenarios bypass multi-signature guarantees?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Maximum Participants] Does validate_map handle the case where included.len() approaches usize::MAX, potentially causing memory exhaustion or overflow in the + 1 operation at line 55?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Medium - Empty Map] If the map parameter is empty and included only contains 'ours', does validate_map correctly accept this as valid (threshold=1 case)?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - Participant Zero] If Participant can represent zero (0), does validate_map handle it correctly, or could participant index 0 bypass validation checks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error: InvalidParticipantQuantity] [Medium - Expected vs Actual] The InvalidParticipantQuantity error at lines 36-37 reports expected and actual counts - could reporting these exact values aid timing attacks or participant enumeration?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error: InternalError Variants] [High - Internal Error Coverage] Are all internal error conditions properly mapped to InternalError, or could some panics or unexpected states occur that aren't captured by FrostError?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error: Error Exhaustiveness] [Critical - Missing Errors] Does FrostError cover all possible failure modes in FROST signing (nonce reuse, binding factor collision, transcript inconsistency), or could some attack scenarios go undetected?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Validation: Participant Uniqueness] [Critical - Duplicate Detection] Does validate_map's check at line 55-56 definitively prevent duplicate participants in 'included' from being used in signature generation, or could hash collisions defeat this?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Validation: Threshold Enforcement] [Critical - Count Accuracy] The map.len() + 1 check at line 55 assumes 'ours' is the only missing participant - if multiple participants are missing from map but only one is in included, could this bypass threshold?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Rust: Panic Safety] [High - Unwrap/Expect Usage] Does validate_map or other code in lib.rs use unwrap() or expect() that could panic in adversarial inputs, causing DoS?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Rust: Overflow] [Medium - Arithmetic Safety] The expression map.len() + 1 at line 55 lacks overflow checking - in debug builds this panics, but in release builds could it wrap?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Rust: Iterator Safety] [Medium - Iterator Exhaustion] The for loop at line 59 iterates over 'included' slice - could an extremely large slice cause excessive CPU usage or memory access, causing DoS?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Rust: Trait Derivations] [Low - Derive Macro Safety] FrostError derives Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Debug at line 27 - do all these derivations preserve security properties, or could they leak sensitive information?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Rust: Error Trait] [Medium - Error Trait Impl] FrostError derives thiserror::Error at line 27 - does the Error trait implementation properly sanitize any sensitive information in error messages?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Included Validity] Does validate_map assume 'included' is already sorted/validated, or could an unsorted or invalid 'included' slice cause incorrect validation results?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [High - HashMap Capacity] Could an attacker cause HashMap rehashing during validation by providing specific participant patterns, leading to timing variations that leak information?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Type: Generic T] [Medium - Type Parameter Constraints] The validate_map function is generic over T with no bounds - could this allow types with side effects in Drop, Clone, or PartialEq implementations?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: Public Surface] [High - API Minimality] Does lib.rs expose the minimal necessary API, or do the pub use re-exports at lines 10, 20 leak internal types that should be kept private?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Documentation: Module Docs] [Low - Missing Security Notes] Does lib.rs module documentation warn about critical security requirements like nonce reuse prevention, or could developers misuse the API?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - Early Return] If an error is returned early from validate_map (e.g., at line 56), could this create observable timing differences that leak information about participant configuration?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error: DuplicatedParticipant] [High - Detection Completeness] The DuplicatedParticipant error at line 62 only triggers when 'ours' is in the map - are duplicates among other participants detected elsewhere, or could they slip through?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Function: validate_map()] [Critical - HashMap::contains_key] [Medium - Timing Sensitivity] Does HashMap::contains_key at lines 61, 67 have constant-time guarantees, or could timing variations reveal participant set composition?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Type: Participant] [High - Participant Comparison] How is Participant equality determined in HashMap operations? Could custom Eq/Hash implementations lead to inconsistent validation?"
