  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [High - InvalidSigningSet] The InvalidSigningSet error at lines 34-35 takes a &'static str reason - are all possible invalid signing set scenarios properly covered, or could some bypass detection?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Medium - Participant Disclosure] Errors like DuplicatedParticipant and MissingParticipant at lines 38-41 explicitly include participant identifiers - does this enable participant enumeration attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Critical - InvalidPreprocess vs InvalidShare] The errors InvalidPreprocess (line 44) and InvalidShare (line 46) only identify the participant - is this sufficient to identify and blame malicious participants, or could honest participants be falsely blamed?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [High - Error Recovery] When FrostError is returned, is there a clear recovery path, or could certain errors leave the signing session in an unrecoverable state requiring DKG restart?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Error Enum: FrostError] [Medium - PartialEq on Errors] FrostError derives PartialEq at line 27 - could error comparison be used to leak information about which participants provided invalid data in a multi-party protocol?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: Re-exports] [High - Public API Exposure] The pub use at line 10 exposes Participant, ThresholdParams, ThresholdKeys, ThresholdView from dkg module - are these types properly validated before use in FROST signing?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: curve] [Critical - Curve Trait Safety] The curve module at line 13-14 is declared but its safety properties are not visible in lib.rs - could unsafe curve implementations bypass FROST security guarantees?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: algorithm] [High - Algorithm Trait] The algorithm module at line 17 is public - could custom Algorithm implementations violate FROST security properties (e.g., deterministic nonces, proper challenge generation)?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: nonce] [Critical - Nonce Module Privacy] The nonce module at line 18 is not pub, only mod - but could internal nonce generation issues leak into the public API through sign module exports at line 20?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: sign] [Critical - Sign Protocol Exposure] The sign module is publicly exported at line 20 - are all state machines properly protected against state manipulation or replay attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: tests] [Low - Test Exposure] The tests module at lines 23-24 is conditionally exposed - could test code or test utilities be misused in production builds to bypass security checks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: DKG Integration] [Critical - ThresholdKeys Binding] ThresholdKeys is imported from dkg at line 10 - is there proper validation that keys used in FROST signing match the keys generated by DKG, preventing key substitution attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: Trait Bounds] [High - Generic Type Safety] Does lib.rs enforce sufficient trait bounds on re-exported types to prevent misuse, or could users instantiate FROST with insecure curve or algorithm implementations?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: Feature Flags] [Medium - Conditional Compilation] The tests module uses cfg attributes at line 23 - could feature flag combinations create unsafe configurations or expose internal APIs?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Module: Error Propagation] [High - Cross-Module Error Handling] FrostError is defined in lib.rs but used across all submodules - are all error cases properly mapped, or could some failures go unreported?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Type: Participant] [Critical - Participant Validation] Participant is re-exported from dkg at line 10 - does lib.rs enforce that Participant values are always in valid range (1..=n) across all FROST operations?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Type: ThresholdParams] [High - Threshold Configuration] ThresholdParams is exposed at line 10 - can users instantiate FROST with invalid threshold values (t < (2n/3 + 1)) that weaken security?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Type: ThresholdView] [Critical - View Consistency] ThresholdView is public at line 10 - could inconsistent views between participants lead to signature forgery or threshold bypass?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Type: ThresholdKeys] [Critical - Key Lifecycle] ThresholdKeys are exposed without clear ownership/lifecycle semantics - could keys be reused across different signing contexts, enabling cross-protocol attacks?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Generic: Curve Trait] [High - Curve Parameter Validation] The Curve trait from line 14 is used generically - does lib.rs ensure that only approved, secure curves are used, or could weak curves be instantiated?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Documentation: README] [Low - Documentation Accuracy] Line 2 includes the README as documentation - if implementation diverges from documentation, could this lead to misuse of the API?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Concurrency: validate_map] [High - Thread Safety] Is validate_map thread-safe when called concurrently with overlapping participant sets? Could race conditions in HashMap access lead to validation bypasses?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [State: Error State] [Medium - Error State Management] When FrostError is returned from validate_map or other functions, is there proper cleanup of any partial state that might affect subsequent operations?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Lifetime: Static Strings] [Low - Static Lifetime] FrostError uses &'static str at line 30 and 35 - could this prevent proper error context from being provided in dynamic scenarios?",
  "[File: crypto/frost/src/lib.rs] [Integration: DKG to FROST] [Critical - Key Handoff] The transition from DKG-generated keys to FROST signing is implicit in the type re-exports at line 10 - are there proper handoff validation checks to prevent using unconfirmed or compromised keys?"
