  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [Low - Update Call Overhead] Each append() makes 3 update() calls - if update() has high overhead, can frequent append() calls DoS validators?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Critical - Protocol Separation] If Bitcoin and Monero signing both use new(b'serai-signing'), can an attacker replay a Bitcoin signature as a Monero signature?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [High - Cross-Network Replay] If domain_separate() doesn't include the network ID (Bitcoin/ETH/Monero), can an attacker replay DKG messages across networks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [High - Cross-Session Binding] If session IDs are not included in early transcript messages, can an attacker cause transcript collision between different validator set epochs?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Transcript] [Medium - Cross-Implementation Attack] If different parts of Serai use different Transcript implementations (Merlin vs Digest), can an attacker cause state confusion?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Type: Challenge] [High - Output Size Variance] The Challenge type is Output<D> which varies by digest - if FROST code assumes 64-byte challenges but gets 32 bytes, can this break binding?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Output Encoding] The challenge output is raw bytes - if FROST expects big-endian scalar representation but gets little-endian, can this weaken security?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [Medium - Seed Bias] Truncating challenge output to 32 bytes - if the digest has non-uniform output distribution, can this introduce bias in DKG randomness?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: new()] [Medium - Static Data Race] The &'static [u8] requirement prevents runtime labels - but can compilation with link-time optimization cause static data to be merged incorrectly?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: domain_separate()] [Low - Static String Deduplication] If the compiler deduplicates static strings, can two logically different domain labels share the same address and cause confusion?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Trait: SecureDigest] [High - Implementation Trust] SecureDigest is auto-implemented for any Digest with >=256-bit output - can a malicious or buggy Digest implementation break all transcript security?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Medium - Finalize Idempotency] Does calling finalize() multiple times on a cloned digest produce identical output, or can state mutation cause different challenges?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append()] [Medium - Update Buffering] If Digest::update() buffers data internally and flushes non-deterministically, can this cause validators to observe different intermediate states?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 24-25] [Medium - Test Feature Leakage] The tests module is conditionally compiled - if production code accidentally depends on test-only behavior, can this cause consensus bugs?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Line: 1] [Low - No_std Compatibility] The #![no_std] attribute - are there std-dependent features in dependencies that could cause linking errors in some build configurations?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [Critical - Binding Factor Collision] In FROST, if multiple signing sessions use overlapping transcript states, can binding factors collide and enable signature forgery?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Critical - Participant Set Binding] If the set of FROST participants is not bound to the transcript before DKG, can an attacker perform a subset attack?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: challenge()] [High - Group Commitment Binding] Are FROST group commitments properly bound to the transcript, or can an attacker substitute commitments from a different session?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [High - Preprocess Generation] If preprocessed nonces use rng_seed() without session-specific binding, can preprocesses be reused across sessions?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: append_message()] [Medium - Share Ordering] In DKG, if shares are added to the transcript in non-deterministic order (e.g., based on network timing), can this cause key derivation divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Type: Output<D>] [Medium - Type Erasure] The challenge returns Output<D> which is digest-specific - if code accidentally mixes outputs from different digests, can this cause type confusion?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: rng_seed()] [Medium - Array Truncation Safety] The truncation to [u8; 32] uses [.. 32] - if Output<D> is somehow < 32 bytes despite SecureDigest bounds, this panics - is this possible?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Trait: Transcript] [Medium - Concurrent Challenge] If multiple threads call challenge() on clones of the same transcript simultaneously, can race conditions in the Digest implementation cause non-deterministic output?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: zeroize()] [Low - Concurrent Zeroize] If zeroize() is called while another thread is reading the transcript, can this cause data races?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/transcript/src/lib.rs] [Function: zeroize()] [High - Optimizer Bypass] The black_box() call is meant to prevent optimization, but newer Rust versions may have more aggressive optimizers - is this future-proof?"
