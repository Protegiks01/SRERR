  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [HashSet/HashMap Security - Low] Do the HashSet (line 54) and HashMap (line 142) use cryptographically secure hash functions, or can hash flooding attacks cause DoS?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Clone Safety - Medium] Are transcript.clone() calls (line 95) deep clones that prevent shared mutable state, or can shallow cloning cause data races?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Rust] [Type Coercion - Low] Can implicit type conversions between usize, u16, and Participant hide overflow or truncation issues?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Crypto] [Binding Factor Security - Critical] Are binding factors computed via hash_to_F (line 83) uniformly distributed in the scalar field, or can bias be exploited for Wagner's attack?",

  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Crypto] [Scalar Field - Medium] Can scalars generated via hash_to_F ever equal the field modulus or zero, causing key cancellation or invalid signatures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Crypto] [Point Compression - High] Do compressed point encodings via to_bytes() preserve point uniqueness, or can two different internal representations of the same point cause duplicate detection failures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Crypto] [Generator Assumption - Critical] Does the code assume C::generator() is a fixed, known value, or can curve parameter attacks substitute malicious generators?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Crypto] [Cofactor Handling - Medium] For curves with cofactors > 1, does musig() properly handle cofactor clearing to prevent invalid point attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Crypto] [Key Derivation - High] Is deriving the public key from a private key (line 121) secure against related-key attacks or backdoor key injection?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Single Participant - High] What happens if musig() is called with keys.len() = 1? Does it create a valid 1-of-1 threshold key or fail?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Maximum Participants - Medium] If keys.len() = u16::MAX, can various u16 arithmetic operations (e.g., i+1) overflow or wrap around?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Zero Context - Medium] What happens if context = [0u8; 32]? Does this create a default/weak key binding?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Identical Keys - High] If all keys in the array are identical (after passing duplicate check via different byte representations), what is the resulting group key?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Wrong Key Order - Critical] If two validators provide the same keys but in different orders, do they compute different group keys, causing consensus failure?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Private Key Zero - High] What happens if private_key = F::ZERO is provided to musig()? Does it create an invalid/unusable key share?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Edge Case] [Interleaved Calls - Medium] Can multiple concurrent musig() calls with overlapping keys cause race conditions or state corruption?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Testing] [Rogue Key Test - Critical] Does the test suite verify that musig() is vulnerable to rogue key attacks, or does it only test honest-party scenarios?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Testing] [Timing Test - Medium] Are there tests that verify musig_key() executes in constant time compared to musig_key_vartime()?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Testing] [Stress Test - Medium] Does the test suite include stress tests with keys.len() near u16::MAX to verify overflow handling?",

  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Testing] [Cross-Ciphersuite Test - High] Does the test suite verify musig() works correctly across different ciphersuites (Ristretto, Ed25519, Secp256k1, etc.)?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Rogue Key Warning - Critical] Does the documentation explicitly warn that musig() is vulnerable to rogue key attacks without proof-of-possession, and should only be used with pre-verified keys?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Context Format - High] Is the expected format and uniqueness requirements for the context parameter documented, or can developers misuse it?"
