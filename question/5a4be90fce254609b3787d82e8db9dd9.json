  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Non-Usability - High] Does the comment 'does not guarantee the usability of the resulting key' (line 115) mean that musig() can produce keys that fail during signing? What are the conditions?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Documentation] [Thread Safety - Medium] Is musig() documented as thread-safe, and can it be safely called concurrently from multiple threads?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Key Cancellation - Critical] Can an attacker who controls k out of n validators provide keys such that the binding factors cause the other n-k honest keys to sum to zero in the multiexp?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Signature Forgery - Critical] If musig() keys are used with FROST signing, can the lack of proper DKG (just key aggregation) enable signature forgery attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Key Extraction - High] Can an attacker who observes multiple signatures using musig() keys extract individual validator private keys via lattice attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Cross-Protocol - High] Can musig() keys intended for one protocol (e.g., Bitcoin) be misused in another protocol (e.g., Ethereum) if contexts are not protocol-specific?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Precomputation Attack - Medium] Can an attacker precompute binding factors for common key sets and contexts to speed up rogue key attacks?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Replay Attack - High] Can old musig() keys from previous validator sets be replayed in new sessions if context values are predictable or reused?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Side Channel - Medium] Can power analysis or electromagnetic attacks on validators running musig() extract private keys during the multiexp computation?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Attack Vector] [Fault Injection - High] Can fault injection attacks during musig() computation cause validators to produce different group keys, enabling double-signing?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_keys()] [Malformed Input - Medium] Can check_keys() handle keys that are valid curve points but fail other cryptographic checks (e.g., points at infinity, low-order points)?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: check_keys()] [Reorg Safety - Low] If check_keys() is called during a chain reorganization, can it accept different key sets and cause fork inconsistency?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: binding_factor_transcript()] [Padding Attack - Medium] Can an attacker add padding to context or keys that gets stripped during processing, causing different transcripts for logically equivalent inputs?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: binding_factor()] [Preimage Resistance - High] If hash_to_F lacks sufficient preimage resistance, can an attacker find contexts that produce target binding factors to control the group key?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig_key_multiexp()] [Multiexp Failure - Medium] What happens if multiexp() returns an error or invalid result? Is this handled gracefully or does it panic?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Ownership Transfer - Low] Does musig() consume the private_key via Zeroizing, preventing accidental reuse, or can the key be cloned before the call?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Participant Ordering - Critical] Does the Participant ID numbering (1-indexed) match the keys array indexing (0-indexed) consistently across all validators?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Function: musig()] [Verification Share Consistency - High] Can verification_shares contain entries for participants not in the final threshold keys, causing signing failures?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Cutting] [Determinism - Critical] Is every computation in this file deterministic across different platforms, compilers, and optimization levels, or can subtle differences cause validator divergence?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Cutting] [Backwards Compatibility - Medium] If the binding factor or transcript format changes in a future version, can old and new implementations interoperate during upgrades?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Cutting] [Error Recovery - Medium] When musig() fails with DkgError, is the validator state consistent, or can partial failures cause state corruption?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Cutting] [Concurrency - Low] Does this code use any shared mutable state that could cause data races if called from multiple threads?",
  "[File: serai/crypto/dkg/musig/src/lib.rs] [Cross-Cutting] [Fuzz Testing - Medium] Has this code been fuzz-tested with malformed inputs, extreme values, and random data to discover edge cases?"
