  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Coordinator Protocol] In the coordinator-processor protocol, can a malicious processor provide incorrect challenges to sign(), causing validators to produce invalid signatures? (CRITICAL)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: batch_verify()] [Batch Atomicity] If batch verification fails for a mixed batch of valid/invalid signatures, does the entire batch get rejected, or can partial acceptance occur? (HIGH)",

  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Reattempt Safety] If the coordinator requests signature reattempts, can the same nonce be reused across attempts, leaking the private key? (CRITICAL)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Mint Authorization] When verifying signatures for mint instructions, does verify() enforce that the signature authorizes the exact minted amount, or can rounding enable value extraction? (CRITICAL)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Burn Authorization] For burn instructions, does verification ensure the signature authorizes the specific external address, or can address substitution occur? (CRITICAL)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Multisig Threshold] In the t-of-n threshold multisig, does the signing process enforce that exactly t participants contributed, or can t-1 colluding validators forge signatures? (CRITICAL)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Economic Limits] Does verification enforce the economic security invariant that external funds don't exceed 33% of allocated stake, or is this checked elsewhere? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Key Rotation] During validator set rotation, can old-session signatures be replayed with new-session keys, enabling unauthorized transfers? (CRITICAL)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Swap Authorization] When verifying signatures for AMM swap instructions, does verify() bind to the exact input/output amounts and slippage parameters? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Liquidity Add] For liquidity provision signatures, can verify() detect if the signed amounts don't maintain the xy=k invariant? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Fee Handling] Does the signature bind to fee amounts, or can fee manipulation occur between signing and execution? (MEDIUM)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Minimum Output] Can the minimum output amount in a swap be modified after signature verification but before execution? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Pool Manipulation] Can an attacker get multiple swap signatures signed and then order execution to manipulate pool ratios for profit? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [SCALE Encoding] Does the signature bind to the exact SCALE-encoded instruction bytes, or can encoding variations create signature reuse? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: sign()] [Instruction Type] Does the challenge bind to the instruction type discriminant (In vs Out), or can instruction type confusion occur? (HIGH)",
  "[File: serai/crypto/schnorr/src/lib.rs] [Function: verify()] [Network Binding] Is the signature bound to the specific external network (Bitcoin/Ethereum/Monero), or can cross-network replay occur? (CRITICAL)",
